# Typical-Harry-Cloak
#### This is a typical Harry potter's invisible cloak made with OpenCV.
- You need a Bright shiny Orange-Red cloak to play with.

#### Backgroud.py
 - This is bascially to capture your background and save it in the present directory.
 - Click "q" to capture.
#### Invisible.py
 - This is the main file, where you can play with the Red cloak.
   Just put on the cloth on you and execute the file. You are now wearing harry's cloak.
   You observe that the previous captured image is visible when you are under the red cloth.
   
   ###### So, First execute Background.py, click q and then run Invisible.py, now put on your Red-cloak you will see the magic. :crystal_ball:
   
   
### I also used Morphological Transformations for better experience!
